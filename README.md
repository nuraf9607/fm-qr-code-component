## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While I was working on this project I tried to write as less code as possible while
getting the desired results, fortunately I was able to do this without writing more code

```html
 <div class="text-content">
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p class="desc">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills
      to the next level
    </p>
 </div>
```

```css
.b-r {
  border-radius: 0.8rem;
}

```

### Continued development

I have seen so much great use case of grid layouts, but this is something i am still not comfortable using, and want to refine it for the future



### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped to do a complete reset of the project I am working with.
